# BalloonShootingGame
This is a simple balloon shooting game build in Java for my My first-year project.
## Game feature includes:
- Main menu
- Game difficulty (Normal mode & hard mode)
- Scoring and life system

## 🎮 How to Play

**Goal:** Pop the **red** balloons to score points while avoiding mistakes that cost lives.

### Controls
- **Mouse:** Click balloons to pop them.
- **R:** Restart the game at any time.

### Rules & Scoring
- 🔴 **Red balloon** = +1 score when clicked.
- 🔵 **Blue balloon** = −1 life if you click it.
- ⬆️ **Missed balloon** (reaches the top without being popped) = −1 life.
- 🕒 **Speed-up:** Balloons gradually move faster as time passes.
- ❤️ You start with a limited number of lives (shown top-right). When lives reach 0 → **Game Over**.

## ⚡ Game Modes
